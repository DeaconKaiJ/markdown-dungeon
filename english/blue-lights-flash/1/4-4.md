As you stare your heart begins to race and the loud hum returns, this time more painful.

You also begin to notice blue eyes emerging from the woods, multiple of them,

the same eyes you saw on this being.

The pain from the hum increase, you feel youself loosing conciousness, as this happens you see these things break out into a sprint towards you.
